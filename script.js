  // ── 8 ── ВТБ Оплата / VTB Payment ──────────────────────────
  8: {
    context: 'Not every user opens a banking app to explore new features. Most of the time they open it with one goal — to transfer money as quickly as possible: to parents, to a friend, to pay for internet, to send money to a colleague. This is one of the most common scenarios in a mobile bank, repeated dozens of times a month. Yet every time, the user has to go through the same path from scratch: find the transfers section, choose the scenario, find the recipient, fill in the data, confirm the transfer — even though the app already knows who the user transfers to most often. That paradox became the starting point for this research.\n\nAs an exercise, I did a product analysis of the transfer scenario in the VTB app. The goal wasn\'t just to make the interface prettier, but to understand how to shorten the user\'s path to a familiar action.\n\nMain research question: if most transfers are repetitive, why does the app make the user start the process from zero every single time?',

    problem: 'I didn\'t start with interfaces — first I wanted to understand whether the problem actually existed.\n\nA UX audit of the current scenario showed the path: Home → Payments → Transfer → Recipient → Confirmation. Even for a repeat operation, the user had to search for the right section again — transaction history already existed but did nothing to speed up the scenario.\n\nReview mining of user reviews surfaced several patterns: it\'s hard to quickly find the right transfer, there are too many steps to complete, and repeat operations take almost as long as new ones. The action itself wasn\'t the issue — the path to it was.\n\nA benchmark of Tinkoff and Sber showed that both ecosystems bet specifically on the repeatability of user behavior: recent recipients, quick actions, repeat transfers, personal recommendations — all of this lets users start the scenario almost right after opening the app.',

    solution: 'After the research, a simple thought emerged: the user doesn\'t need a new way to transfer money — they need the shortest path to an action they already know. Most operations repeat: the same person, the same amounts, regular payments. That means the app already has all the information it needs to shorten the user\'s path — it just needs to use it.\n\nHypothesis: if the app shows the user their most likely actions right after opening it, they\'ll be able to complete a transfer faster, which will reduce unnecessary navigation and increase the share of successfully completed operations.\n\nThere turned out to be far more ideas than could be built at once. To define the first iteration, I scored the hypotheses by impact on the user scenario and implementation difficulty — the first version included solutions with high potential impact and minimal implementation cost.\n\n1. Quick actions on the home screen ★★★★★\nThe most popular operations now appear next to the balance. The user no longer needs to search for the transfers section — they start the action right after opening the app.\n\n2. Frequent operations ★★★★★\nThe home screen stopped being a showcase for marketing offers — now it first helps the user complete their task. A block with recent recipients and recurring payments appeared: the most likely actions are one tap away.\n\n3. One Tap Payment ★★★★★\nA repeat transfer no longer requires re-entering data: the recipient, amount, and date of the previous transfer are already filled in — the user just needs to confirm the action.\n\n4. Smart search\nSearch stopped searching for sections — now it helps complete an action. Searching "Ivan" instantly shows the recipient\'s card; searching "MTS" offers to pay for mobile service with no menu navigation needed.\n\n5. Predictive hints\nTransaction history starts working for the user: if internet is usually paid on the 25th, the app proactively offers to do it in one tap — instead of searching for the function, the user gets a ready-made action.',

    userFlow: 'Before:\nHome → Payments → Transfers → Recipient → Confirmation\n\nAfter:\nHome → Last recipient → Confirmation\n\nThe number of steps is cut almost in half.',

    designSystem: 'To support the new scenarios, I designed: cards for recent recipients, compact action buttons, a bottom sheet for choosing the operation, success and error states, personal hints, and quick-action components. All elements share consistent behavior patterns and scale easily to other mobile-banking scenarios.',

    results: 'The next step after development should be an A/B test.\n\nKey metrics:\n— Time to Complete Payment — time to complete a transfer\n— Task Success Rate — share of successfully completed operations\n— Drop-off Rate — share of users who left the scenario\n— Number of Steps — number of actions needed to complete a transfer\n\nExpected result: shorter task-completion time, fewer drop-offs, and more convenient day-to-day operations.\n\nWorking on this case reaffirmed for me that improving a product doesn\'t always require building new features. Sometimes the most valuable scenario already exists — the path to it is just too long. A good mobile bank doesn\'t make the user hunt for a familiar action: it anticipates their intent and helps them complete the task in the fewest possible steps.',

  // ── 0 ── FinCorp ──────────────────────────────────────────
  0: {
    context: 'Fin Corp is a financial product that helps users manage money: make payments, track balances, and build savings. The savings module is one of the key tools for long-term product use, since it\'s directly tied to users\' financial habits and their engagement with the service.',

    problem: 'User behavior analysis showed that the savings feature was used irregularly and didn\'t form a lasting habit.\n\nKey problems:\n— users didn\'t fully understand how savings progress was calculated\n— there was no transparent link between actions and results\n— savings were perceived as a "static amount" rather than a process\n— low emotional engagement with reaching goals\n\nAs a result, users didn\'t return to the feature regularly and didn\'t see savings as a tool for managing their financial goals.',

    solution: 'Goal: increase engagement with the savings feature and make it a clear tool for building financial goals. Business and product goals: increase the regularity of interaction with savings, strengthen understanding of progress, improve retention in long-term scenarios, and create a sense of control and forward motion.\n\nHypothesis: if savings progress becomes more transparent and shifts from a static number to a dynamic process, users will return to the feature more often and use it more actively.\n\nProcess: I analyzed user behavior in savings scenarios — how often people open this section, at what point interest drops off, which interface elements go unnoticed, and how users interpret progress. Key insight: a user doesn\'t read a number as "movement" unless they see a clear cause-and-effect link between their actions and the change in their savings.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. A transparent progress model — reworked the logic for displaying savings: progress became the central interface element, the "before → after" connection was strengthened visually and logically, and a clear structure was added: current status, goal, remaining amount. Goal: make progress readable without cognitive interpretation.\n\n2. Strengthening the link between action and result — users now clearly see how each deposit affects overall progress: changes are reflected immediately, the dynamics of the change are made clearer, and the "abstractness" of savings is reduced. Goal: create a sense of control and causality.\n\n3. Shifting from a static entity to a process — savings were reframed as a process of reaching a goal rather than just a balance: the focus moved from a number to motion, the interface reinforces the feeling of "getting closer to the goal," and the motivational element was strengthened. Goal: increase engagement through a sense of progress.\n\n4. Reducing cognitive load — simplified how the data is interpreted: ambiguous states were removed, the number of "understanding steps" was reduced, and the visual hierarchy highlights what matters most. Goal: the user understands the system\'s state within 1–2 seconds.',

Users rarely think of delivery as a standalone service — for them it\'s an extension of the purchase, so expectations form not around the technology but around a feeling of control. Users want to know three things: where the order is, when it will arrive, and what happens if something goes wrong.\n\nKey insight: the problem with autonomous delivery isn\'t a lack of trust in drones — it\'s that users stop understanding the system\'s state. The less predictable the process feels, the faster trust in the product drops — so the interface needs to explain the system before the user starts asking questions.\n\nDesign principles:\n\n1. Make autonomy understandable — the autonomous system should explain its actions in simple, human language.\n\n2. Design for uncertainty — not just successful deliveries, but every exception scenario should be part of the user journey.\n\n3. Keep users in control — even a fully automated delivery should create a feeling of control.\n\n4. Build trust through transparency — every action the system takes should be explainable.\n\nInstead of a single app, I designed a service platform combining several components.\n\nDrone Ports — orders are picked up at dedicated pickup stations. This removes the risk of an unsafe landing, protects the order from theft, reduces the impact of human error, and works even when the user isn\'t present.\n\nSmart Routing — before every flight, the system automatically evaluates weather conditions, airspace restrictions, route congestion, battery charge, and the availability of the nearest Drone Port. If a safe flight isn\'t possible, the order is automatically switched to express courier delivery with no need to reorder.\n\nSystems Thinking: DroneDrop wasn\'t designed as a drone-control interface but as an ecosystem including users, the logistics platform, autonomous aircraft, Drone Port infrastructure, support services, and the urban environment. Much of the work focused on service scenarios and system states rather than individual app screens.',

Users don\'t need to understand how an autonomous drone works, but they should always understand what\'s happening with their order, why the system is making certain decisions, and what happens next. Transparency of process is exactly what becomes the key to a successful user experience in next-generation products.',

  5: {
    context: 'Panorama Lounge is a premium restaurant in Dobrograd. Despite a high level of service, the experience of browsing the menu remained fragmented: guests only saw the paper menu once seated at the table, couldn\'t explore the offerings in advance, and the restaurant had no way to adapt offers to demand or analyze interest in specific dishes.\n\nThe project called for a digital menu that would accompany the guest throughout the whole journey — from first learning about the restaurant to placing an order.',

    problem: 'The paper menu worked fine as a dish catalog, but it didn\'t help guests make decisions and didn\'t solve the restaurant\'s business needs.\n\nResearch surfaced several key problems:\n— guests spent a lot of time choosing dishes\n— seasonal offers went unnoticed\n— waitstaff repeatedly answered the same questions about ingredients and pairings\n— the restaurant had no data on which items guests were actually interested in\n— prospective guests couldn\'t check the current menu before visiting\n\nAs a result, the restaurant was missing opportunities to raise the average check, promote special offers, and set expectations before a visit.',

    solution: 'My role: Product Design, UX Research, Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Design System, Prototyping. I owned the full product design cycle — research, concept development, designing user scenarios, information architecture, interfaces, and the admin panel.\n\nDesign principles:\n\n1. Reduce cognitive load — cut the number of decisions a guest has to make when choosing a dish.\n\n2. Support confident decision-making — help guests choose without needing to ask a waiter.\n\n3. Surface relevant content — naturally promote seasonal offers and recommendations within the choosing flow.\n\n4. Design for multiple contexts — one product needed to work equally well whether the guest was browsing at home or right at the table.\n\nInstead of a digital copy of the paper menu, I designed a standalone product combining several usage scenarios.\n\nFor guests: browsing the menu via the website or a QR code, easy category navigation, search, dish photos, ingredients and allergens, chef\'s recommendations, drink pairings, favorites, table booking, and calling a waiter.\n\nFor the business: an admin panel, assortment management, publishing seasonal offers, view and popularity analytics for dishes, and tracking guest interest in the menu.\n\nThe key shift was rethinking the digital menu\'s role: instead of a dish catalog, the product became a decision-making tool. For guests, it shortens choosing time and makes the experience more comfortable. For the restaurant, it becomes a communication channel, a way to promote special offers, and a source of data about user behavior.',

    competitorAnalysis: 'I analyzed existing digital solutions on the market: QR menus, restaurant websites, and booking services. The research showed that most products focus on displaying information but barely help users make a decision.\n\nThe main insight was that the problem isn\'t a lack of information — it\'s how it\'s presented. Guests need quick answers to: what to choose, whether a dish suits me, what pairs well with it, and whether the restaurant is even worth visiting.',

    context: 'Beyosa — интернет-магазин товаров для сна: матрасов, кроватей, диванов и аксессуаров.\n\nПокупка мебели — дорогостоящее решение, поэтому процесс оформления заказа должен вызывать доверие, быть максимально понятным и не отвлекать пользователя от завершения покупки.\n\nПо данным аналитики воронки оформления заказа был обнаружен высокий процент выхода пользователей после перехода из корзины к оформлению. Основные потери происходили на этапах выбора доставки и заполнения контактных данных. Дополнительно UX-аудит выявил перегруженные формы и отсутствие понятного сценария выбора способа получения.',

    problem: 'Анализ текущего оформления заказа показал несколько ключевых проблем.\n\n— Пользователю приходилось заполнять большое количество полей без понимания, какие из них действительно обязательны.\n— Разные способы доставки работали по разным сценариям и создавали ощущение хаотичного процесса.\n— Информация о стоимости заказа была недостаточно заметной во время оформления.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight"> Гипотеза: Если пользователь будет видеть итоговую стоимость на каждом этапе оформления, это снизит тревожность перед покупкой и уменьшит количество возвратов к предыдущим шагам.\n— Рассрочка представляла собой отдельный сценарий, который выбивал пользователя из процесса покупки.\n— Не хватало обратной связи при заполнении форм и обработке ошибок.\n— Интерфейс было сложно масштабировать при добавлении новых способов доставки и оплаты.',

    solution: 'Редизайн оформления заказа строился вокруг пяти ключевых UX-решений.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">1. Зафиксировала итоговую стоимость заказа</strong>. Выдвинула гипотезу: Если закрепить итоговую стоимость на каждом шаге, пользователь будет реже возвращаться назад в корзину «на всякий случай» — а именно этот возврат, по данным Я.Метрики, был у 23% пользователей на этапе доставки.\nПроверка: сделала два варианта — (А) sticky-блок с итогом внизу экрана, (Б) итог только в шапке. Прогнала быстрый юзабилити-тест на 5 пользователях(коридорное исследование среди сотрудников компании не связанных с продуктом).\nЧто увидели: вариант А снизил количество возвратов в корзину с 23% до 9%, вариант Б почти не дал эффекта — пользователи его не замечали в шапке.\nВывод: гипотеза подтвердилась, но только при sticky-размещении — выбрали вариант А в финальное решение.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">2. Разделила сценарии доставки</strong>\nВместо одной большой формы доставка разделена на два отдельных сценария — курьерскую доставку (адрес, комментарий, дата) и самовывоз (карта, список магазинов, наличие товара). Пользователь видит только нужные поля и не перегружается лишней информацией.\nПервая версия была единой формой с переключателем — но в юзабилити-тесте пользователи путались, какие поля относятся к какому способу получения. Разделили на два независимых.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">3. Интегрировала карту выбора магазина</strong>\nПри самовывозе пользователь может посмотреть ближайшие точки, выбрать удобный магазин и увидеть адрес и режим работы — карта помогает ориентироваться быстрее, чем длинный список адресов.\nПервая гипотеза была — заменить список картой полностью. Но тест показал, что часть пользователей (обычно 35+, судя по сегментам) быстрее ориентируется по тексту. Решили оставить оба варианта, а не выбирать один.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">4. Встроила рассрочку в основной сценарий</strong>\nРассрочка стала частью оформления заказа, а не отдельным процессом: пользователь выбирает способ оплаты, заполняет нужные данные и возвращается к оформлению заказа — это снижает вероятность того, что он бросит покупку после перехода на новый экран.\nБыла развилка: либо встроить в checkout, либо оставить отдельным флоу с переходом на страницу банка/партнёра. Технически второй вариант проще, но с точки зрения UX создаёт риск потери пользователя — то есть был компромисс между удобством разработки и конверсией, и я сознательно выбрала сторону конверсии.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">5. Добавила понятные состояния интерфейса</strong>\nДля всех форм продуманы пустые состояния, заполнение, ошибки, успешная валидация и блокировка кнопки до заполнения обязательных полей — это помогает пользователю быстрее исправлять ошибки и завершать оформление.',

    context: '⚠️ Тестовое задание для Т-Банка, выполненное на отборочном этапе — не коммерческий проект и не отражает реальные продуктовые процессы банка.\n\nТ-Банк выводит на рынок новый продукт — беспилотное такси. Для пассажиров запускаются выгодные тарифы и специальные предложения, а сам сервис пока работает в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге с планами на расширение географии.\n\nЗадача — спроектировать десктопный сервис мониторинга беспилотного автопарка для инженеров центра мониторинга: помочь им отслеживать состояние машин, быстро выявлять проблемы и принимать решения. Каждый автомобиль передаёт в систему данные о статусе (в поездке / свободна / на зарядке / вне сервиса), уровне заряда, технических неисправностях, ошибках и местоположении.',

    problem: 'Про эксплуатацию беспилотных автопарков я не знала почти ничего, поэтому начала с погружения и списка вопросов: сколько машин закреплено за одним инженером, работает ли он в режиме постоянного наблюдения или только реагирует на инциденты, какие типы проблем вообще возникают и есть ли у них приоритет, кому и как инженер передаёт эскалацию.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">Цель бизнеса</strong> — сделать эксплуатацию флота предсказуемой и максимально эффективной: минимизировать простой машин, ускорить восстановление после инцидентов и обеспечить масштабируемость сервиса при выходе в новые города. <strong class="proj-highlight">Миссия пользователя</strong> — помочь инженеру быстро выявлять инциденты, оценивать их критичность и принимать решения, не теряя времени на поиск нужного контекста.\n\nКлючевые метрики, на которые должен влиять интерфейс: MTTI и MTTR (среднее время обнаружения и устранения инцидента), Fleet uptime (доля машин в рабочем состоянии), количество предотвращённых инцидентов и NPS инженеров, для которых этот интерфейс — основной рабочий инструмент.',

    solution: 'Прежде чем перейти к экранам, провела кабинетное исследование и бенчмаркинг существующих паттернов Ops-систем и дашбордов мониторинга транспорта — от отчётов об инцидентах NHTSA до трекеров автопарков. Это помогло понять, какие форматы уже привычны инженерам, которые каждый день работают с похожими интерфейсами.\n\nНа основе исследования сформулировала и приоритизировала 12 гипотез — по влиянию на сценарий и сложности реализации. В первую версию вошли решения с максимальным эффектом при минимальной стоимости разработки:\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">1. Приоритизация инцидентов</strong> — критичность считывается по цвету и порядку в списке; без неё невозможно управлять потоком проблем.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">2. Список как основной рабочий инструмент</strong> — стандартный для мониторинговых систем паттерн, который позволяет быстро сканировать и сравнивать задачи.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">3. Фильтрация и сортировка</strong> — без фильтров по типу, статусу и критичности список быстро перегружается, и инженер теряет фокус на релевантных задачах.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">4. Контекст в карточке инцидента</strong> — статус машины, заряд и локация видны сразу, без лишних переходов: без этого контекста инженер не может принять решение.\n\n<strong class="proj-highlight">5. Управление статусом инцидента</strong> — инженер переключает статус (в работе / мониторинг / эскалация / закрыт) и фиксирует принятое решение, не теряя контроль над задачами.\n\nГруппировку инцидентов, сохранение контекста при переходах и историю по машине отнесла к среднему приоритету, а AI-сводку по инциденту и прогнозирование поломок — к развитию продукта в будущем: ценность высокая, но сложность реализации пока слишком велика для первой версии.',

    competitorAnalysis: 'Изучила паттерны существующих решений для управления автономным транспортом и промышленного мониторинга: платформу Wheels для управления беспилотными автопарками, отчёты об инцидентах NHTSA, дашборды безопасности автономных такси и трекеры автопарков со статистикой по машинам и маршрутам.\n\nОбщий вывод бенчмаркинга: практически все зрелые системы мониторинга строятся вокруг списка как главного рабочего инструмента, цветовой приоритизации критичности и карточки объекта, в которой сразу собран весь нужный для решения контекст — без этого инженер тратит время не на решение проблемы, а на поиск информации о ней.',

    context: 'Не каждый пользователь приходит в банковское приложение изучать новые функции. Чаще всего он открывает его с одной целью — как можно быстрее перевести деньги: родителям, другу, оплатить интернет, отправить деньги коллеге. Это один из самых популярных сценариев мобильного банка, который повторяется десятки раз в месяц. Но каждый раз пользователю приходится проходить один и тот же путь заново: найти раздел переводов, выбрать сценарий, найти получателя, заполнить данные, подтвердить перевод — хотя приложение уже знает, кому пользователь переводит чаще всего. Именно этот парадокс стал отправной точкой исследования.\n\nВ качестве упражнения я провела продуктовый анализ сценария переводов в приложении ВТБ. Цель была не просто сделать интерфейс красивее, а понять, как сократить путь пользователя до привычного действия.\n\nОсновной вопрос исследования: если большинство переводов повторяются, почему приложение каждый раз заставляет пользователя начинать процесс с нуля?',

    problem: 'Работу начала не с интерфейсов — сначала хотелось понять, действительно ли проблема существует.\n\nUX-аудит текущего сценария показал путь: Главная → Платежи → Перевод → Получатель → Подтверждение. Даже для повторной операции пользователю приходилось заново искать нужный раздел — история операций уже существовала, но никак не помогала ускорить сценарий.\n\nReview mining отзывов пользователей приложения выявил несколько закономерностей: сложно быстро найти нужный перевод, приходится выполнять слишком много действий, повторные операции занимают почти столько же времени, сколько новые. Само действие не вызывало сложностей — проблемой оказался путь до него.\n\nБенчмарк решений Т-Банка и Сбера показал, что обе экосистемы делают ставку именно на повторяемость поведения пользователя: последние получатели, быстрые действия, повтор перевода, персональные рекомендации — всё это позволяет начинать сценарий практически сразу после открытия приложения.',

    researchImage: 'assets/Исследование_VTB.jpg',

    solution: 'После исследования появилась простая мысль: пользователю не нужен новый способ перевода — ему нужен самый короткий путь к уже знакомому действию. Большинство операций повторяются: один и тот же человек, одинаковые суммы, регулярные платежи. Значит, приложение уже обладает всей информацией, чтобы сократить путь пользователя, — остаётся только использовать её.\n\nГипотеза: если показывать пользователю его наиболее вероятные действия сразу после открытия приложения, то он сможет завершать перевод быстрее, что уменьшит количество лишних переходов и повысит долю успешно завершённых операций.\n\nИдей оказалось значительно больше, чем можно было реализовать сразу. Чтобы определить первую итерацию, я оценила гипотезы по влиянию на пользовательский сценарий и сложности реализации — в первую версию вошли решения с высоким потенциальным эффектом и минимальной стоимостью внедрения.\n\n1. Быстрые действия на главном экране ★★★★★\nСамые популярные операции появились рядом с балансом. Теперь пользователю не нужно искать раздел переводов — он начинает действие сразу после открытия приложения.\n\n2. Частые операции ★★★★★\nГлавный экран перестал быть витриной маркетинговых предложений — теперь он сначала помогает выполнить задачу пользователя. Появился блок с последними получателями и повторяющимися платежами: самые вероятные действия оказываются в одном касании.\n\n3. One Tap Payment ★★★★★\nПовторный перевод больше не требует повторного ввода данных: получатель, сумма и дата предыдущего перевода уже заполнены — пользователю остаётся только подтвердить действие.\n\n4. Умный поиск\nПоиск перестал искать разделы — теперь он помогает выполнить действие. Запрос «Иван» сразу показывает карточку получателя, запрос «МТС» предлагает оплатить связь без переходов по меню.\n\n5. Предиктивные подсказки\nИстория операций начинает работать на пользователя: если обычно интернет оплачивается 25 числа, приложение заранее предлагает сделать это одним нажатием — вместо поиска нужной функции пользователь получает готовое действие.',

    userFlow: 'До изменений:\nГлавная → Платежи → Переводы → Получатель → Подтверждение\n\nПосле изменений:\nГлавная → Последний получатель → Подтверждение\n\nКоличество шагов сокращается почти в два раза.',

    designSystem: 'Для поддержки новых сценариев были разработаны: карточки последних получателей, компактные action-кнопки, bottom sheet выбора операции, состояния успеха и ошибки, персональные подсказки, компоненты быстрых действий. Все элементы используют единые паттерны поведения и легко масштабируются на другие сценарии мобильного банка.',

    uikitImage: 'assets/Design System Sections VTB.png',

    results: 'Следующим этапом после разработки должен стать A/B-тест.\n\nКлючевые метрики:\n— Time to Complete Payment — время выполнения перевода\n— Task Success Rate — доля успешно завершённых операций\n— Drop-off Rate — процент пользователей, покинувших сценарий\n— Number of Steps — количество действий до завершения перевода\n\nОжидаемый результат — сокращение времени выполнения задачи, снижение числа отказов и рост удобства ежедневных операций.\n\nВо время работы над кейсом я ещё раз убедилась, что улучшение продукта не всегда требует создания новых функций. Иногда самый ценный сценарий уже существует — просто путь к нему оказывается слишком длинным. Хороший мобильный банк не заставляет пользователя искать привычное действие: он предугадывает его намерение и помогает выполнить задачу за минимальное количество шагов.',

    context: 'AI PM Assistant — AI-инструмент для продуктовых команд, который помогает Product Managers и командам быстрее переходить от идеи к решению: формировать продуктовые гипотезы, анализировать пользовательские проблемы, структурировать функции, создавать PRD и принимать продуктовые решения. Продукт используется в рабочих сценариях, где важно быстро превращать неструктурированные идеи в понятные продуктовые действия.\n\nПосле анализа поведения пользователей стало понятно, что большинство взаимодействий оставались поверхностными: пользователи воспринимали AI как обычный чат-бот и не использовали его потенциал как инструмент продуктового мышления.',

    problem: 'AI давал ответы, но не помогал принимать продуктовые решения.\n\nАнализ пользовательских сессий выявил несколько ключевых проблем:\n\n1. Низкое качество входящих запросов — пользователи часто формулировали слишком общие вопросы: «Как улучшить приложение?», «Придумай новую функцию». Без контекста AI не мог дать глубокий продуктовый результат.\n\n2. AI воспринимался как чат, а не рабочий инструмент — текущий сценарий выглядел так: Запрос → Ответ → Завершение. Но реальный процесс Product Manager выглядит иначе: Проблема → Исследование → Гипотеза → Решение → PRD → Эксперимент. Интерфейс не поддерживал этот процесс.\n\n3. Отсутствовала структура продуктовых задач — пользователь начинал работу с пустого поля и должен был самостоятельно определить, что спросить, какой контекст предоставить и какой результат ожидать. Это создавало высокую когнитивную нагрузку.',

    solution: 'Design Challenge: как превратить AI PM Assistant из универсального чат-интерфейса в продуктового партнёра, который помогает PM структурировать задачи и принимать решения?\n\nКлючевой инсайт: главная проблема была не в качестве AI-модели, а в отсутствии UX-структуры, которая помогает пользователю правильно сформулировать задачу и перейти от идеи к решению. Чем меньше структуры получает пользователь на входе, тем менее полезным становится результат взаимодействия с AI.\n\nМы изменили модель взаимодействия. Было: пустой чат — пользователь пишет запрос, AI отвечает. Стало: структурированный AI workflow — продуктовая цель → выбор сценария → добавление контекста → AI-анализ → структурированный результат → итеративная работа над решением.\n\nРешение:\n\n1. Scenario-based Entry Points — вместо пустого поля пользователь выбирает тип задачи: Generate Ideas (поиск новых продуктовых возможностей), Analyze Problem (анализ пользовательской проблемы), Create Hypothesis (формирование и проверка гипотез), Build PRD (создание структуры продуктового требования). Это помогло пользователям понимать возможности AI и быстрее начинать работу.\n\n2. Prompt Guidance System — добавлены направляющие элементы: примеры качественных запросов, подсказки по структуре, рекомендации по добавлению контекста. До: «Improve onboarding». После: «Проанализируй причины падения активации новых пользователей. Цель — увеличить completion rate onboarding. Предложи гипотезы и варианты экспериментов».\n\n3. Product Thinking Workflow — ответ AI был преобразован из обычного текста в рабочий продуктовый артефакт: Проблема → User Insight → Гипотеза → Решение → Метрики успеха → План эксперимента.\n\n4. Iterative AI Collaboration — добавлена возможность развивать результат: AI формирует гипотезы → PM уточняет → AI помогает приоритизировать → создаётся PRD.

Продукт ориентирован на сценарии, в которых скорость доставки становится частью пользовательского опыта: срочная замена рабочего оборудования, забытые аксессуары, подарки «день в день» и другие покупки, требующие получения в течение часа.\n\nВ отличие от традиционных служб доставки, DroneDrop рассматривает последнюю милю как интеллектуальную систему, объединяющую автономные летательные аппараты, городскую инфраструктуру, цифровой сервис и логистическую платформу. Цель продукта — сократить время между покупкой и получением заказа, сохранив высокий уровень безопасности, прозрачности и предсказуемости процесса.',

    problem: 'Большинство сервисов экспресс-доставки оптимизируют работу курьеров, но сама модель доставки остаётся прежней.\n\nПри проектировании DroneDrop задача заключалась не в замене человека дроном, а в создании новой модели взаимодействия между пользователем, автономной системой доставки и городской инфраструктурой. Это означало необходимость учитывать сразу несколько ограничений: погодные условия, городскую застройку, безопасность пользователей, ограничения воздушного пространства, сохранность техники, сценарии отказа системы.\n\nОсновной вызов заключался в том, чтобы сделать технологически сложную систему понятной и предсказуемой для пользователя.',

    solution: 'Моя роль: Product Design, UX Strategy, Service Design, Systems Thinking, Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Prototyping. Я спроектировала пользовательский опыт, сервисную архитектуру и взаимодействие между цифровым продуктом и физической инфраструктурой доставки, уделяя особое внимание сценариям неопределённости и отказоустойчивости системы.\n\nProduct Vision: DroneDrop проектировался как сервис, который позволяет пользователю перестать думать о процессе доставки. Главная цель — сделать автономную доставку настолько понятной и предсказуемой, чтобы пользователь воспринимал её так же естественно, как вызов такси или заказ еды.\n\nИсследование: я изучила существующие модели последней мили — традиционную курьерскую доставку, постаматы, экспресс-доставку и международные проекты автономной логистики. Пользователи редко воспринимают доставку как самостоятельный сервис — для них это продолжение покупки, поэтому ожидания строятся не вокруг технологии, а вокруг ощущения контроля. Пользователь хочет понимать три вещи: где находится заказ, когда он прибудет и что произойдёт, если что-то пойдёт не по плану.\n\nКлючевой инсайт: проблема автономной доставки не в отсутствии доверия к дронам, а в том, что пользователь перестаёт понимать состояние системы. Чем менее предсказуемым становится процесс, тем быстрее снижается доверие к продукту — поэтому интерфейс должен объяснять систему раньше, чем пользователь начинает задавать вопросы.\n\nПринципы проектирования:\n\n1. Make autonomy understandable — автономная система должна объяснять свои действия простым человеческим языком.\n\n2. Design for uncertainty — не только успешная доставка, но и любые исключительные ситуации должны быть частью пользовательского сценария.\n\n3. Keep users in control — даже полностью автоматизированная доставка должна создавать ощущение контроля.\n\n4. Build trust through transparency — каждое действие системы должно быть объяснимым.\n\nВместо отдельного приложения была спроектирована сервисная платформа, объединяющая несколько компонентов.\n\nDrone Ports — получение заказа происходит через специализированные станции выдачи. Это исключает риск небезопасной посадки, защищает заказ от кражи, снижает влияние человеческого фактора и обеспечивает работу даже при отсутствии пользователя.\n\nSmart Routing — перед каждым вылетом система автоматически оценивает погодные условия, ограничения воздушного пространства, загруженность маршрутов, заряд аккумулятора и доступность ближайших Drone Port. При невозможности безопасного полёта заказ автоматически переводится на экспресс-доставку курьером без необходимости повторного оформления.\n\nSystems Thinking: DroneDrop проектировался не как интерфейс управления дроном, а как экосистема, включающая пользователей, логистическую платформу, автономные аппараты, инфраструктуру Drone Port, службы поддержки и городскую среду. Значительная часть работы была посвящена сервисным сценариям и состояниям системы, а не отдельным экранам приложения.',
